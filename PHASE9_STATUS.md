# Phase 9 Status

Implemented a paper-ready pipeline with a reproducible grid runner, fresh smoke and unit tests, and an analysis script that summarizes results into tables and figures. Use `scripts/run_experiment_grid.py` with `configs/experiments/phase9.yaml` to regenerate results under `results/phase9/`, then run `python analysis/phase9_analysis.py --root_dir results/phase9` to rebuild tables. Remaining TODOs: expand figure styling and add more exhaustive hyper-parameter sweeps for publication.
