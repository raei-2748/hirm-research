# Design history

The project originally evolved through numbered internal phases. Those labels have been replaced with semantic experiment suites:
- **Baseline benchmark** (formerly Phase 7): core ERM/IRM/GroupDRO/VREx/HIRM comparisons on synthetic and SPY data.
- **Ablation study** (formerly Phase 8): registry-driven ablations to probe the contribution of HIRM components.
- **Full experiment suite** (formerly Phase 9): publication grid combining all datasets, methods, and diagnostics.

Archived phase-specific notes and configs are available under `docs/history/` for reproducibility.
